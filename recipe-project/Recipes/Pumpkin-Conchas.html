        <ul>
            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>½ cup pumpkin puree</li>

            <li>¼ cup warm milk</li>

            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>

            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

            <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Topping</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>

            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground allspice</li>

            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>

            <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

            <li>¼ cup butter, at room temperature</li>

            <li>orange food coloring (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, pumpkin puree, warm milk, egg yolk, melted butter, sugar, active
            <br>dry yeast, salt, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough</br>
            hook attachment. Mix until a smooth, slightly elastic ball forms or knead by
            <br>hand for about 5 minutes.</br></li>

            <li><p>Place the dough in a lightly greased mixing bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm
            <br>place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</br></p></li>
            
            <li><p>While dough is rising, combine powdered sugar, flour, butter, cinnamon, allspice,
            <br>nutmeg, salt, and vanilla extract in a bowl for the topping. Mix with your hands or</br>
            a spatula until a moldable dough forms. Mix in orange food coloring if you like.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Divide topping dough into 6 equal portions and shape them into balls; set onto a
            <br>parchment lined baking sheet. Cover each ball with a sheet of plastic and press down</br>
            with something flat and heavy (like the bottom of a glass or measuring cup) into a flat circle.
            <br>Take the tip of a knife and score a pumpkin design into the topping. Place in the refrigerator</br>
            to allow butter to firm up.</p></li>

            <li><p>After the dough rises, transfer it onto a work surface and press down to remove the air.
            <br>Cut into 6 equal portions and roll each portion into a smooth ball. Transfer balls onto a</br>
            Silpat-lined baking sheet and press down to flatten lightly. Place the topping on top of the
            <br>dough balls. Allow to proof until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.</br></p></li>
        
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>

            <li><p>Bake in the center of a preheated oven until puffed up and golden, about 20 minutes.
            <br>Allow to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.</br></p></li>
        </ol>
